# **Flying Torosordos: ISO 27001 Executive Summary**

### **Project Overview**

This project outlines a strategic plan to establish an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** for Flying Torosordos, a fictional global tech startup. The plan, which aligns with **ISO 27001**, identifies critical security gaps and provides a phased roadmap to build a robust and compliant security program that is tailored to the company's unique operational environment and long-term strategic goals.

### **Current Security Posture & Risks**

A comprehensive analysis of the company's security posture reveals both key strengths and significant vulnerabilities. While the company has a strong foundation in place with **robust backups**, **financial controls**, and a living **asset inventory**, several critical risks were identified:

* **Physical Access:** The lack of controlled access to the office space poses a high risk to company assets.  
* **Data Integrity:** The database was not implemented with a **least privilege** policy, allowing for unauthorized changes.  
* **Confidentiality:** The use of shared accounts and reliance on a public Wi-Fi network exposes the company to data interception and credential theft.  
* **Hardware Failure:** The company's on-premises hard drives are at risk due to a lack of a climate-controlled storage area.

### **Key Recommendations & Actions**

To mitigate these risks and achieve compliance, a multifaceted plan was developed and implemented:

* **Governance and Policies:** A new access control policy was implemented, enforcing **strong passwords**, **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**, and forbidding account sharing. A new training program was also established to address key cyber threats and secure data handling.  
* **Physical Security:** The company successfully relocated to a more secure office space with **badged entry** and is establishing a secure, climate-controlled area for critical assets.  
* **Network & Data Security:** **Network segmentation** has been implemented, and all internet traffic is now encrypted with a **VPN**. A strategic transition to a fully **cloud-based solution** is also underway to improve security and scalability.  
* **Strategic Planning:** A formal **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)**, a **Vendor Onboarding Process**, and a **Formal Audit Plan** have been established to ensure a continuous and proactive approach to security.

### **Skills Demonstrated**

This project demonstrates a range of advanced GRC skills:

* **ISO 27001 Framework:** The ability to design a security program that aligns with a globally recognized standard.  
* **Risk & Gap Analysis:** The ability to identify, assess, and mitigate risks in a business context.  
* **Strategic Planning & Business Acumen:** The ability to develop a practical and cost-effective plan that addresses both security and business goals, including the financial trade-offs of relocating to a new office space.
